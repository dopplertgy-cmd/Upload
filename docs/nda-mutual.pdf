 and


[Party B Name], a [type of entity], with offices at [Address].


Each a “Party” and together the “Parties.”

1. Purpose
The Parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest (the “Purpose”), and in connection with that Purpose, each Party may disclose to the other certain confidential or proprietary information. The Parties desire to protect such information under the terms of this Agreement.

2. Definition of Confidential Information
“Confidential Information” means any non-public, proprietary or confidential information disclosed by one Party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other (“Receiving Party”), whether in written, oral, electronic or other form, that is marked as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, technical data, business plans, strategies, financial information, customer & supplier lists, inventions, processes, designs, software, trade secrets, know-how, and the existence and terms of this Agreement and the Purpose.

3. Exclusions from Confidential Information
Information shall not be considered Confidential Information and the Receiving Party shall have no obligations under this Agreement in respect of any information that:
a. is or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the Receiving Party;
 b. was already known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, without breach of any obligation of confidentiality;
 c. is lawfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it and who did not acquire it under an obligation of confidentiality;
 d. is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or
 e. is required to be disclosed under law, regulation, or court order (provided, when legally permitted, that the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the Disclosing Party, to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or limit the disclosure).

4. Obligations of Receiving Party
The Receiving Party agrees:
a. to keep the Confidential Information in strict confidence, and not to disclose it to any third parties except as permitted hereunder;
 b. to use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose;
 c. to restrict access to Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors or representatives who have a need to know it, and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Agreement;
 d. to take at least the same security measures to protect the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.

5. Term; Duration of Confidentiality Obligations
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue until [Term, e.g. 1 year, 2 years], or until terminated by either Party with [notice period, e.g. 30 days] written notice to the other.


Notwithstanding the termination, the Receiving Party’s obligations with respect to each item of Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall survive for [number of years, e.g. 3, 5] years after the date of disclosure (or longer if required by applicable law, e.g. if the information qualifies as a trade secret).



6. Return or Destruction of Materials
Upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all tangible materials (and electronic copies) containing or embodying the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, including all copies, summaries or extracts thereof, and certify in writing that such return or destruction has been completed.

7. No License / No Rights Granted
Nothing in this Agreement grants the Receiving Party any rights, by license or otherwise, in or to Confidential Information other than as may be necessary to fulfill the Purpose. All Intellectual Property rights remain with the Disclosing Party.

8. Remedies
Each Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages alone may be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or equity.

9. Governing Law; Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State] without regard to its conflict of laws rules. The Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [City, State] for any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.

Amendments: Any amendment must be in writing and signed by both Parties.


Severability: If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, that shall not affect the remaining provisions, which will continue in full force.


Notices: Any notices required or permitted hereunder must be in writing and delivered to the addresses set forth above (or updated in writing).


Assignment: Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (except to a successor entity in the event of merger or sale of substantially all assets, provided the successor agrees to be bound).
